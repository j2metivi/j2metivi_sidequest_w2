## Project Title

Side Quest Week 2: Anxious Blob Platformer

---

## Description

This project is a p5.js platformer featuring a soft, animated blob whose movement and environment have been redesigned to express fear.  
The blob becomes unstable and jittery in dark spaces, with movement that feels skittish and hesitant rather than confident.  
Environmental lighting and drifting background shadows reinforce a sense of unease without introducing enemies or combat, focusing instead on emotional expression through motion and atmosphere.

## Interaction Instructions

- Use `A / D` or `← / →` to move left and right
- Press `W`, `↑`, or `Space` to jump (only when grounded)
- Move toward lighted areas to calm the blob
- Darkness increases the blob’s panic, making movement less stable and visibility more limited

Watch how the blob’s body deformation and movement change based on its emotional state.
